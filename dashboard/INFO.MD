#Recording demonstration final version

Wednesday (June 28th), Thursday (June 29th) or Friday (June 30th) you will give a demonstration of the final version of your project in the VideoStudio (@SP A1.12). Don’t panic: just your voice, and the screen of your phone (App Studio) or the screen of your laptop (Data Processing) will be recorded. Marijn Jansen and Mirja Lagerwaard will help you with the recording.


The recording of your demonstration will be used by the teachers and assistants to assess your final version and will not be publicly distributed without your permission.

Finally, add the appointment of the recording to your own calendar.

###Preparation

Prepare the demonstration of your final version and practice **as often as possible**. The following points should be mentioned during your demonstration:

* Make sure you introduce your project briefly at the start of the demonstration.
* Give a short demonstration of the final version and explain how the application is built technically.  
* What problems did you encounter and how did you solve them?
* Are there any bugs in the final version that you have not been able to solve?
* In an ideal world with a plenty amount of time: what would you have added to the final version?

Perform your demonstration in **Dutch**. Make sure your demonstration **does not last longer than 7 minutes**. PowerPoint or other tools are not allowed!

###Be on time! …

… otherwise we will not be able to help you to record your demonstration.

###The recording

The location of the recording is **@SP A1.12**. Bring your **own equipment** so you will be able to give your demonstration, including charger(s) and cables etc. If the door of A1.12 is closed you can take place on one of the chairs outside. If it is your turn to record your demonstration we will come out to get you. The recording (including installing the equipment) will take about 15 minutes in total.
