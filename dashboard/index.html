        The Syrian Archive is a Syrian initiative that strives to promote
        sustainable peace and respect for human rights within Syrian society
        through facilitating justice and accountability. This includes evidence
        gathering and documentation of incidents; the acknowledgment that war
        crimes and human rights violations have been committed by all sides; the
        identification of perpetrators to end the cycle of impunity and the
        development of a process of justice and reconciliation.

        Their mission is to:

        Support human rights advocates and citizen journalists in their
        efforts to document human rights violations in Syria by developing
        new tools to increase the quality of political activism, future
        prosecutions, human rights reporting and research on Syria.

        Preserve and organise documentation relating to human rights
        violations in Syria committed by all actors in the conflict by
        providing a secure online repository and a database of metadata
        information to contextualise videos, audios, pictures and documents. <br><br>

        The Syrian Archive is visualized on this website. Each visualization
        has been picked to highlight a different aspect of the information which
        can be found in the database:

        <text id="h2grey"><p>
          when
        </p></text>
        The Calendar View Heatmap is useful to see the amount of preserved
        incidents over time. How many preserverd incidents took place on one
        day? How did the amount of preserved incidents develop over time?

        <text id="h2grey"><p>
          where
        </p></text>
        The map of Syria gives more insight into where the preserved incidents
        took place. This visualisation is also useful when more information
        about one incident is demanded.

        <text id="h2grey"><p>
          what
        </p></text>
        The Barchart reveals the amount of preserved incidents per type of violation.
