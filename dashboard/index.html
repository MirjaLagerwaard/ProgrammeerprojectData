          THE SYRIAN ARCHIVE

      <text id="h3grey">

        The Syrian Archive is an initiative launched by a collective of human
        rights activists dedicated to preserving open source documentation
        relating to human rights violations and other crimes committed by all
        sides during the conflict in Syria. <br><br>

        Their goal is to preserve the most valuable material to ensure it is
        organized and accessible for use by current researchers, journalists
        and others with an interest in the conflict as well as to facilitate
        the work of future historians and investigators involved in transitional
        justice and accountability efforts. <br><br>

        Their missions are: <br>

        <p>
          <text id="h2grey">
            mission one
          </text>
        </p>
        Support human rights advocates and citizen journalists in their
        efforts to document human rights violations in Syria by developing
        new tools to increase the quality of political activism, future
        prosecutions, human rights reporting and research on Syria.

        <p>
          <text id="h2grey">
            mission two
          </text>
        </p>
        Preserve and organise documentation relating to human rights
        violations in Syria committed by all actors in the conflict by
        providing a secure online repository and a database of metadata
        information to contextualise videos, audios, pictures and documents. <br><br><br>

        Information about the incidents which are included in the The Syrian
        Archive is visualised on this website. The goal of this visualisation is
        to increase awareness of the scale of the human rights violations in
        Syria and to obtain more insight into the background of the incidents.
        Each visualisation has been carefully picked to highlight a different
        aspect of the incidents background information:

        <text id="h2grey"><p>
          when
        </p></text>
        The Calendar Heatmap can be utilised to see the amount of incidents over
        time. How many incidents took place on one day? How did the amount of
        incidents develop over time? 

        <text id="h2grey"><p>
          where
        </p></text>
        The Map of Syria gives more insight into where the incidents took place.
        This visualisation is also useful when more information about only one
        incident is demanded. When did that particular incident take place?
        What is the type of violation? What happened?


        <text id="h2grey"><p>
          what
        </p></text>
        The Barchart displays the amount of incidents per type of violation. What is the most common type of violation? Does the amount of incidents per type of violation change over the years? <br><br>

        Click on the "visualisation" button in the menu to explore each individual
        visualisation and how the visualisations are linked to each other.
