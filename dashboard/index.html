          THE SYRIAN ARCHIVE

      <text id="h3grey">

        The Syrian Archive is an initiative launched by a collective of human
        rights activists dedicated to preserving open source documentation
        relating to human rights violations and other crimes committed by all
        sides during the conflict in Syria. <br><br>

        Their goal is to preserve the most valuable material to ensure it is
        organized and accessible for use by current researchers, journalists
        and others with an interest in the conflict as well as to facilitate
        the work of future historians and investigators involved in transitional
        justice and accountability efforts.

          <text id="h2grey">
            mission one
          </text>
        </p>
        Support human rights advocates and citizen journalists in their
        efforts to document human rights violations in Syria by developing
        new tools to increase the quality of political activism, future
        prosecutions, human rights reporting and research on Syria.

          <text id="h2grey">
            mission two
          </text>
        </p>
        Preserve and organise documentation relating to human rights
        violations in Syria committed by all actors in the conflict by
        providing a secure online repository and a database of metadata
        information to contextualise videos, audios, pictures and documents. <br><br>

        The Syrian Archive is visualized on this website. Each visualization
        has been picked to highlight a different aspect of the information which
        can be found in the database:

        <text id="h2grey"><p>
          when
        </p></text>
        The Calendar Heatmap is useful to see the amount of preserved
        incidents over time. How many preserverd incidents took place on one
        day? How did the amount of preserved incidents develop over time?

        <text id="h2grey"><p>
          where
        </p></text>
        The map of Syria gives more insight into where the preserved incidents
        took place. This visualisation is also useful when more information about
        one incident is demanded. For example, what kind of weapon is used?

        <text id="h2grey"><p>
          what
        </p></text>
        The Barchart reveals the amount of preserved incidents per type of violation.
        What is the most common type of violation? Changes the amount of preserved
        incidents per type of violation over the years? <br><br>

        Click in the menu on the visualisation button to explore each individual
        visualisation and how the visualisations are linked to each other.
